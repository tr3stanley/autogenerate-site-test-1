PASTE PROJECT DESCRIPTION HERE

We are using this template to create a new website. Use the unsplash MCP to add images. Ensure that you only use the screenshots as a guide but follow our brand  guide for the overall colors and fonts. Create a home page, services page and contact page. Ensure that each hero section on each page has an image unless otherwise noted. Ask me any clarifying questions you need to know before proceeding

Create a PRD and use the taskmaster MCP to help you break the project down into bite sized tasks. work through each task systematically until the site is completed, at which point we can go back through and make improvements if needed. Stop only to update the completed tasks. Try to keep it under 5 tasks if possible
