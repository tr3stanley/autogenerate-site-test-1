I'll help you commit and push the current files to GitHub. Let me start by checking the git status and then proceed with the commit and push process.

---

```bash
git status
```

```
tr3st@Tstans:~/projects/in-use-gmg-free-site-template$ git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .cursor/
        .cursorindexingignore
        .specstory/
        Prompt-blueprint.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
tr3st@Tstans:~/projects/in-use-gmg-free-site-template$
```

---

Now I'll add all the files and make the initial commit:

---

```bash
git add .
```

```
tr3st@Tstans:~/projects/in-use-gmg-free-site-template$ git add .
tr3st@Tstans:~/projects/in-use-gmg-free-site-template$
```

---

Now I'll make the initial commit:

---

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit with project blueprint and setup files"
```

```
<it commit -m "Initial commit with project blueprint and setup files"
[main (root-commit) e244d96] Initial commit with project blueprint and setup files
 5 files changed, 758 insertions(+)

 create mode 100644 Prompt-blueprint.md
tr3st@Tstans:~/projects/in-use-gmg-free-site-template$
```

---

Perfect! The files have been committed. Now I need to check if there's a remote repository configured. Let me check the remote origins:

---

```bash
git remote -v
```

```
tr3st@Tstans:~/projects/in-use-gmg-free-site-template$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/GMG-Web-Design/in-use-gmg-free-site-template.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/GMG-Web-Design/in-use-gmg-free-site-template.git (push)
tr3st@Tstans:~/projects/in-use-gmg-free-site-template$
```

---

Great! I can see that the remote repository is already configured. Now I'll push the commits to GitHub:

---

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

```
tr3st@Tstans:~/projects/in-use-gmg-free-site-template$ git push -u origin main
